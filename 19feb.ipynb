    "Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. It was created by Armin Ronacher. Advantages of using Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight and flexible: Flask is a lightweight framework that allows developers to create web applications quickly and easily without the need for extensive setup or configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask has a simple and intuitive interface that is easy to learn for developers with basic knowledge of Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular design: Flask has a modular design that allows developers to choose and use only the components they need. This makes Flask very flexible and adaptable to different project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask can be easily extended with additional libraries and modules, making it easy to integrate with other technologies and frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in development server: Flask has a built-in development server that allows developers to test and debug their applications easily without the need for additional setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large community: Flask has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the framework by creating extensions, tutorials, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for multiple databases: Flask supports multiple databases such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, which makes it easy to work with different data storage solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’. Attach the screenshot of the output in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "from flask import Flask  #importing Flask\n",
    "app=Flask(__name__) \n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route(\"/\") # decoration with app class\n",
    "def hello_world(): \n",
    "    return \"<h1> Hello, World!!<h1>\" # printing the https string code\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\": \n",
    "    app.run(host=\"0.0.0.0\") \n",
    "Flask Application.png\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "In Flask, app routing refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions that are responsible for generating the content that will be displayed when the URL is visited. Flask uses decorators to map a URL to a function.For example, consider the following Flask app:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def index():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/about')\n",
    "def about():\n",
    "    return 'About page'\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(host =\"0.0.0.0\")\n",
    "In this example, we have defined two routes using the @app.route decorator. The first route maps the URL '/' to the index function, which returns the string 'Hello, World!' when the URL is visited. The second route maps the URL '/about' to the about function, which returns the string 'About page' when the URL is visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to define the different pages and functionality of our web application. By mapping URLs to functions, we can create a hierarchical structure for our application, with different pages accessible via different URLs. This makes it easy to organize our code and create a logical flow for our users as they navigate our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message “Welcome to ABC Corporation” and a “/” route to show the following details:\n",
    "Company Name: ABC Corporation Location: India *Contact Detail: 999-999-9999\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app1= Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app1.route(\"/welcome\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def welcome_page():\n",
    "    return \"<h1> Welcome to ABC Corporation <h1>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "@app1.route(\"/\")\n",
    "def details():\n",
    "    return \"<h1><pre>Company Name: ABC Corporation <pre> <pre>Location: India <pre> <pre>Contact Detail: 999-999-9999<pre><h2>\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app1.run()\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the url_for() function.\n",
    "In Flask, the url_for() function is used for URL building. It generates a URL based on the name of a function and any arguments passed to it. The url_for() function takes the name of the function as its first argument and any keyword arguments as additional arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "# creakting a function to check the pass fail\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app2=Flask(__name__)\n",

    "    result=''\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    if marks>=50:\n",
    "        result=\"pass_x\"  # not the here the variable should match with the previous defination name not only pass or fail\n",
    "        #in this cell it has been fail_x and pass_x\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        result=\"fail_x\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "    #return f\"<h1> The Pesron has {result} with {marks} marks <h1>\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return \\\n",
    "redirect(url_for(result, score=marks )) # url takes 2 arguments one the end point and the argument, \n",
    "                                                # here score is used in previous methods and marks has been used at the end method\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__==\"__main__\":\n",
    "    app2.run(debug=True, use_reloader=False)\n",
    "For example, if you visit http://localhost:5000/result/70, the result_x() function will determine that the marks parameter is greater than or equal to 50, so it will redirect the request to the pass_x() function with a score parameter of 70. The pass_x() function will then be called and it will return a string that says \"Congratulations! You have passed with 70 marks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit http://localhost:5000/result/30, the result_x() function will determine that the marks parameter is less than 50, so it will redirect the request to the fail_x() function with a score parameter of 30. The fail_x() function will then be called and it will return a string that says \"Oops! You have failed with 30 marks. Better luck next time.\""
